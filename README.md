## What We Learned

**micro:bit: Supported Features in Scratch 3**
- **micro:bit : Senor**: Implementation of micro:bit left/right tilt sensor.
- **micro:bit : Button**: Implementation of micro:bit Button.
- **micro:bit : LEDs**: Implementation of micro:bit LEDs display.

**Scratch 3 Concepts**
- **Motions**: Use various concept to set & get positions of elements.
- **Messages**: Use Scratch messages concept to send informations to sprites.
